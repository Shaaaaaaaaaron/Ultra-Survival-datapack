Coop challenge datapack for Minecraft 1.16

Game mode idea by ElRichMC, I just wanted to make it into a datapack :)

**[Download the datapack](https://github.com/Shaaaaaaaaaron/Ultra-Survival-datapack/releases)**

[Planet Minecraft page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/ultra-survival-5004553/) (support is appreciated) <3

## About
- This is a cooperative mode, and it needs 2 or more players in order to work
- This is like Ultra Hardcore: there's no natural regeneration, but here, everyone can respawn after dying... but at what cost?
- Every time a player dies, another one will be affected by **losing 2 heart containers** per death (until a max of 1 heart)
  - The fun way would be doing it with less than 6 deaths by the same player, but you can continue if you want
- If there's more than 2 players, a random one will be affected when someone dies
- Use **/trigger ult_sur.reset** to reset everyone's health

## Modes
There are two modes:
- Normal: every time a player dies, only one random player will be affected by losing health (default mode)
- Hard: Every time a player dies, EVERY player will be affected by losing health, including the one who died

To select a mode use **/trigger ult_sur.hard** or **/trigger ult_sur.normal**
(every time you reload the world the normal mode will be selected)

Have fun beating the game or doing other goals with friends!
